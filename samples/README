To run the benchmarks on all the models in newTests/.


1.  Generate a newTests.mk Makefile with

    ./genmk.sh newTests


2.  Build log files for all models with

    make -f newTests.mk

    (Use make -j2 newTests.mk if you have a dualcore with a lot of memory.)


3.  Calculate statistics with

    ./sum.pl newTests/**/*.log

    If you want to filter on a method, use

      ./sum.pl -f '^SLOG' newTests/**/*.log

    to filter on a model, use

      ./sum.pl -f 'ring' newTests/**/*.log

    to filter on a method and a model, use

      ./sum.pl -f '^SOG.*ring' newTests/**/*.log
